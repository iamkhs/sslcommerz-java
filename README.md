# ðŸ’³ SSLCommerz Java (Spring Boot) Payment Gateway Integration

This project provides a **complete Java-based Spring Boot implementation** of the [SSLCommerz Payment Gateway](https://developer.sslcommerz.com/), built for developers in Bangladesh who want to integrate secure online payment capabilities into their Java applications.

It covers the **entire payment flow**, including:

- Initiating payments
- Redirecting to SSLCommerz-hosted payment UI
- Handling success, failure, and cancellation callbacks
- Validating payments using SSLCommerz's validation API

---

## âœ… Key Features

- âœ… Java & Spring Boot 3+ based clean architecture
- âœ… Uses **RestClient** (modern HTTP client introduced in Spring 6)
- âœ… Decoupled service layer for future extensibility
- âœ… `application.properties` driven config
- âœ… Handles both card and mobile banking flows
- âœ… Currently uses **static test data**, but designed for easy extension to support **dynamic runtime data**
